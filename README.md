# üéØ Description

This project aims to understand how PocketBase works, test the types of endpoints it provides, and explore the interface for managing the project.
 

# üíΩ Deployment

<h3> Start proyect Windows </h3> 
 
- Open the PocketBase program to see the commands you can execute. 
```bash
./pocketbase.exe
```   
 
- To start the server, you have to use the following command. 
```bash
./pocketbase.exe serve
```   
- Which should output something like the following:
```bash
2024/05/10 10:55:21 Server started at http://127.0.0.1:8090
‚îú‚îÄ REST API: http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/
‚îî‚îÄ Admin UI: http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/
```   
<h4> üí° Rutas</h4> 
  
`Server` This is the main HTTP address where the project should be configured. <br>
`REST API` This is the HTTP address where client applications can interact. <br> 
`Admin UI` This is the address where the administration panel provided by PocketBase is located.  

# üìÅ‚Äã Project organization  

The project organization is very easy to understand, where: 

- In the `Server` This is the main HTTP address where the project should be configured. <br>
- In the `REST API` This is the HTTP address where client applications can interact. <br> 
- In the `Admin UI` This is the address where the administration panel provided by PocketBase is located.

# üì§‚Äã Endpoints and Request Methods 
   
 
- List/Search (products) `get`   
 
Fetch a paginated products records list, supporting sorting and filtering.  
 
```bash
import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';

const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');

...

// fetch a paginated records list
const resultList = await pb.collection('products').getList(1, 50, {
    filter: 'created >= "2022-01-01 00:00:00" && someField1 != someField2',
});

// you can also fetch all records at once via getFullList
const records = await pb.collection('products').getFullList({
    sort: '-created',
});

// or fetch only the first record that matches the specified filter
const record = await pb.collection('products').getFirstListItem('someField="test"', {
    expand: 'relField1,relField2.subRelField',
});
``` 
 
API details  

```bash
/api/collections/products/records
```    
 
- View (products) `get`   
 
Fetch a single products record.  
 
```bash
import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';

const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');

...

const record = await pb.collection('products').getOne('RECORD_ID', {
    expand: 'relField1,relField2.subRelField',
});
``` 
 
API details  

```bash
/api/collections/products/records/:id
```    
 
- Create (products) `post`   
 
Create a new products record. <br> 
Body parameters could be sent as `application/json` or `multipart/form-data`. <br>
File upload is supported only via `multipart/form-data`. 
 
```bash

const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');

...

// example create data
